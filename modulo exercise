# hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): "))
# mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))

hour = 23
mins = 58
dura = 642

# calculate total number of minutes --> modulo to find amount of end minutes
endMin = (dura + mins) % 60
# if (dura + mins) is less than 60, then the operation resolves to (dura + mins)
# else if (dura + mins) is more than 60 (and not a multiple of 60), then the operation resolves to whatever remains after all multiples of 60 are removed.
# else (dura + mins) is a multiple of 60 and 0 is returned

# convert minutes passing to hours passing
## int() will (1) round answer to integer and (2) handle the edge case of less than zero-hours-passsing by returning 0 
hours2pass = int((dura + mins)/60)

#calculate total number of hours --> modulo to find amount of end hours
endHour = (hour + hours2pass) % 24 
#the logic is the same as line 9 (endMin) because all multiples of 24 hours (if any exist) are removed to only show the hour the event will occur (just like removing multiples
# of 60 minutes to get the minutes)

print(str(endHour) + ":" + str(endMin))
